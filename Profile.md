# Project Logic

## Network Structure in FrontEnd - argument

## Network Parsering and Restore (Simple)

## Profiling the nn.module in Pytorch
Logic:
Run the generated model for several iteration and profiling the memory usage and time consumption for each block in the generated model based on the tensor - simple front end is enough
1. Feature Maps (block, model)
2. Weight Gradients (block, model)
3. Weights (block, model)
4. Dynamic + WorkSpace (profiling for overall model)
